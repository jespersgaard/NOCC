 *) Nocc keeps me asking for a correct login/password.

  -> Check that you correctly configured your POP/IMAP server in conf.php
  ex:

  $servr = "pop.isp.com/POP3:110";

  NOT $servr = "pop.isp.com";

  -> Check that you're allowed to connect to the POP/IMAP server manually.
  Your ISP may not allow people based on the IP.

 *) Having configured Nocc, I get this error with my favourite browser:

  Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imap_open() in /opt/apache/htdocs/nocc/functions.php on line 26

  -> Please check that PHP has IMAP/c-client support (you can use a small
  PHP script with phpinfo() to see what it supports).
  Check the on-line PHP manual to configure IMAP/c-client support

 *) What is this UCB POP Server parameter in the configuration file ?

  -> It's the standard Unix POP server that shipped with early versions of
  various Un*x operating systems flavours.
  UCB stands for University of California/Berkeley
  You can check this by running the following:

  %telnet myhost 110
  Trying...
  Connected to myhost.berkeley.edu.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  +OK UCB Pop server (version 1.6) at myhost starting.
  quit
  Connection closed by foreign host.
