Frequently Asked Questions for Nocc
-----------------------------------

 *) Nocc keeps me asking for a correct login/password.

  -> Check that you correctly configured your POP/IMAP server in conf.php
  ex:

  $servr = "pop.isp.com/POP3:110";

  NOT $servr = "pop.isp.com";

  -> Check that you're allowed to connect to the POP/IMAP server manually.
  Your ISP may not allow people based on the IP.

 *) Having configured Nocc, I get this error with my favourite browser:

  Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imap_open()
  in /opt/apache/htdocs/nocc/functions.php on line 26

  -> Please check that PHP has IMAP/c-client support (you can use a small
  PHP script with phpinfo() to see what it supports).
  Check the on-line PHP manual to configure IMAP/c-client support

	http://www.php.net/manual/ref.imap.php

 *) What is this UCB POP Server parameter in the configuration file ?

  -> It's the standard Unix POP server that shipped with early versions of
  various Un*x operating systems flavours.
  UCB stands for University of California/Berkeley
  You can check this by running the following:

  %telnet myhost 110
  Trying...
  Connected to myhost.berkeley.edu.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  +OK UCB Pop server (version 1.6) at myhost starting.
  quit
  Connection closed by foreign host.

 *) I get session_destroy() errors when logging out of Nocc with PHP 4.0.3
    on Win32.
    Warning: Session object destruction failed...

  -> There's a know session_destroy() bug on PHP for Win32 < 4.0.4
  The problem only affects PHP Win32, not Unix.
  See the bug: http://bugs.php.net/?id=5231

 *) Nocc is slow with a CGI version of PHP when there're big mails

  -> Unfortunately, we tried to optimize the code but some functions are
  clearly very slow in CGI mode. We hope this will be solved in future
  PHP releases.

 *) The trashbox icon is not transparent on Netscape 4.x and some other
    browser.

  -> This is a known issue, Netscape 4.x doesn't support transparent PNG
  images whereas it's ok with GIF. We might switch to GIF again but we
  were wondering about license issues...

 *) I get "Maximum time execution of 30 seconds exceeded" when loading
    a mailbox.

  -> It might be because the networks is slow, a large mailbox or having
  a CGI version of PHP.
  Increase max exec time in php.ini:

  max_execution_time = 300
