Tasks for NOCC. If you think something is missing here,
please send a note to <nocc-discuss at lists.sourceforge.net>.

Short term
----------

 - Change langage files to use an array ($lang_text->...)
 - Create specific icons for attachments.
 - Colored quotes.
 - Should warn when smtp relaying is forbidden instead of silently pretending
   it succeeded in sending mail.

Long term
---------

 - SMTP+Auth support.
 - Cache messages data to speed up loading by logging in POP or IMAP once.
 - QMail aliasing support.
 - RFCs-compliant MIME library, etc.
 - RFC 1894 support (Delivery Status Notification) (?).
 - Dynamic Gzip support: allows live display compression, might speed up when
   connected through slow lines.
 - Look for MX records in a free Webmail version.
 - Switch to pure CSS for color backgrounds, etc. (unlikely to do this soon as
   many browsers/users still won't support it for the next 1-2 years)
 - WML (WAP) version, unlikely to do so as it requires some work and WML is not
   a valid XML DTD.
 - Printer-friendly e-mail formatting.
 - Handling the Delete flag with IMAP.
 - Cleaner BiDi support (arabic for example) with mailbox display.
 - Translate the charset in the mail headers to the charset chosen at login.
 - Webmail user documentation
