TODO list:
=========

short term:

 - Decode MIME with the To: and Attachments' name field
 - Create specific icons for attachments
 - split navigation through mails when there're more than 20 mails and allow
   switching from one another when viewing them

long term:

 - Look for MX records in a free Webmail version
 - Ease installation by detecting if IMAP support is installed
 - Add more languages
 - Switch to pure CSS for color backgrounds, etc.
