   * An IMAP or POP3 server to connect to.

       (Apache+mod_ssl+OpenSSL is popular)

  --------------------
  Installation of NOCC
  ====================
       
       1) Obtain nocc*.tar.gz

       2) untar/gzip nocc into the directory you want.
       
       3) Follow the instructions in the nocc/INSTALL file to properly
          setup NOCC.  
       
       4) Change into the 'nocc' directory, make changes to the 
          config file (conf.php)

           'conf.php' contains a large number of
           defaults that you'll need to configure for your system, such as
           the default IMAP server, whether or not users can pick a
           different server, etc... The file is fairly well documented, so
           you should be able to pick out what you need to change fairly
           easily.

We hope you find NOCC useful and easy to use.  We thank you for taking
the time to try it and if you ever have any questions, just ask.

Enjoy,

The NOCC team
