Known bugs for Nocc
-------------------
Last updated: $Date: 2001/11/25 09:42:44 $

This is a list of known bugs for which we didn't have time to fix properly.
Please report bugs via SourceForge Project Web page.

 Bug: Nocc doesn't send correct "To:" header when sending mail via mail()
      function under Win32 platform only, when SMTP has not been configured
      within Nocc.

 Explanation: When Nocc isn't configured for SMTP on Win32, it will default
              using mail() which internally use a SMTP server (configured with
              php.ini).
              The code which is win32/sendmail.c isn't as full-featured as our
              own SMTP class.
              We believe this is a PHP bug, you can follow the bug here:
              http://bugs.php.net/?id=11247

 Work-around: configure Nocc to use an SMTP server when using Win32.

-----------------------------------

 Bug: Nocc doesn't send mail giving a "Server Error" message when sending a
      mail with Cc: e-mail addresses using Win32 + mail() function only and
      PHP >= 4.0.5

 Explanation: Not yet, this does not occur on Unix systems, only with Win32
              when using the internal sendmail -> SMTP wrapper.
              It does not happen with mails without Cc: or Bcc: headers.
              Does not happen neither with PHP < 4.0.5

 Work-around: configure Nocc to use an SMTP server when using Win32.

----------------------------------

 Bug: There seems to be some problem with POP3 server QPopper.

 Explanation: not yet, we lack of information.

 Work-around: help us debug this by sending a bug report using a sniffer
	      to see what really goes on the network when trying to log in
	      with NOCC. As usual, also send version used, etc.
	      You can also track and update bug #473264.

----------------------------------

 Bug: Invalid range end in functions.php:448

 Explanation: we might use the ereg() function out-of-band but it's not 100%
	      reproducible. If you can help us debug, writing testcase, see
	      bug #464216.
	      Might also be a PHP bug, we don't know yet for sure.

 Work-around: comment line #448 in functions.php
 
 $body = eregi_replace("([#a-zA-Z0-9+-._]*)@([#a-zA-Z0-9+-_]*)\.([a-zA-Z0-9+-_.]+[#a-zA-Z0-9+]*)","<a href=\"$PHP_SELF?action=write&amp;mail_to=\\1@\\2.\\3&amp;lang=$lang\">\\1@\\2.\\3</a>", $body);

---------------------------------

 Bug: Can't use NOCC without accepting cookies

 Explanation: this is a recent regression.

 Work-around: none, we're working on this. Help is welcomed.
