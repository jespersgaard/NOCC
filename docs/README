History:
=======

NOCC started as Epimail, a Webmail for our school as a free project.
The first version was written in Perl because it was powerful, object features, adapted to the Web and available in our school. It also didn't require any superuser privileges.

Webmail clients we found either required database support, superuser privileges or an IMAP server. We had neither of these and we wanted to have something quite simple to access a POP server and an SMTP server.

The Perl version was nice and is now released for your pleasure in GPL (some people already actually committed patches) but it won't work out-of-the-box, we don't have time to write doc neither maintain it anymore).

We started working on Epimail in May 1999 and had it working in July 1999, it's been working for more than 1 year with approx. 150 unique users per day.
The projects has also been used by two companies through some friends who came to know it.

The problem was that it was our first big software written in Perl, and we didn't write it very well, mixing code and HTML, so it was hardly maintainable.
Meanwhile, I discovered PHP and started rewritting it with PHP but lacked SMTP support so sendmail was required. Then submitted my work to Nicolas Chalanset who made a working version by adding proper session feature, etc. and actually used it for a company.

We decided to make a maintainable and public version under GPL so that it can be simple to setup, have POP and SMTP features, MIME decoding, etc. features.
