  Installation of NOCC
  ====================
       
       1) Obtain nocc-x.y.tar.gz (where x and y are version numbers)
	  (or nocc-x.y.zip for Windows' users).

       2) untar/gzip nocc into the directory you want.
       
       3) Follow the instructions in the nocc/INSTALL file to properly
          setup NOCC.  
       
       4) Change into the 'nocc' directory, make changes to the 
          config file (conf.php)

           'conf.php' contains a large number of
           defaults that you'll need to configure for your system, such as
           the default IMAP server, whether or not users can pick a
           different server, etc... The file is fairly well documented, so
           you should be able to pick out what you need to change fairly
           easily.

       5) (Optional step)
	  if you run with suEXEC, you'll need to run addcgipath path to add
	  the parser line.
