Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
All NOCC installation documentation is located in the docs/ subdirectory.
Start by reading the docs/INSTALL file.

Need Help?
~~~~~~~~~~
If you run into problems during the installation, there are multiple
resources as your disposal.  It is highly suggested that you consult them
in this order:

    1)  The documentation distributed with NOCC (found in the docs/
        subdirectory).
    2)  The online, user-editable FAQ, available at http://nocc.sourceforge.net/

Failing to read the documentation before asking a simple question answered
therein will no doubt result in a less-than-welcome response from the mailing
lists.  You've been warned. =)

Thanks,

The NOCC Team
